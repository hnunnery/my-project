- **Bench Player Display**: Fixed issue where bench players weren't showing due to missing reserve field in Sleeper API response

- **Database Schema**: Removed riskScore field from ValueDaily model

- **Processing Speed**: Faster ETL pipeline with fewer irrelevant players
- **Resource Optimization**: Smaller database footprint and improved query performance
- **Batch Processing**: Enhanced batch processing with progress tracking and error handling

### Dynasty Value Algorithm Improvements
- **ADP Value Preservation**: Removed normalization to preserve original ADP meaning (1 = most valuable)
- **Market Value Calculation**: Direct conversion from ADP to 0-100 scale where 1st pick = 100
- **Projection Score**: Now directly based on market value for more accurate dynasty rankings
- **Formula Accuracy**: Better reflects real-world draft value and market sentiment

### Critical Bug Fixes
- **ADP Data Issue**: Fixed incorrect API endpoint that was only returning 100 trending players instead of full ADP data
- **Synthetic ADP Generation**: Implemented intelligent ADP generation for all players based on position value, experience, and injury status
- **Dynasty Value Coverage**: Now generates dynasty values for ALL fantasy-relevant players (~7,200) instead of just 94
- **Data Completeness**: Resolved the root cause of missing dynasty values for 99% of players

### Performance Optimizations
- **Timeout Extension**: Increased ETL timeout from 20 to 25 minutes to accommodate synthetic ADP processing
- **ADP Generation**: Optimized synthetic ADP calculations for better performance
- **Processing Efficiency**: Achieved 6,313 dynasty values (88% coverage) in previous run

### Critical ETL Logic Fix
- **Player Selection Bug**: Fixed ETL to only process players with valid ADP data instead of all 11,161 players
- **Target Processing**: Now correctly processes only ~7,155 fantasy-relevant players instead of including OL, retired, and inactive players
- **Data Quality**: Eliminates 4,855 failed dynasty value calculations from irrelevant players
- **Expected Result**: 100% coverage of target fantasy-relevant players (~7,200 dynasty values)

### Enhanced Player Filtering & Data Quality
- **Age Validation**: Added filtering to exclude players without valid age data (prevents 168 failed calculations)
- **Age Range Filtering**: Exclude players with extreme ages (<18 or >50) for fantasy relevance
- **Enhanced Edge Case Handling**: Improved age score calculation for low ADP players (market value = 0)
- **Data Integrity**: All processed players now guaranteed to have complete data for dynasty value calculation
- **Performance**: Optimized data fetching and caching strategies
- **Image Optimization**: Migrated to Next.js Image component for better performance
- **Next.js Configuration**: Fixed Turbopack configuration for proper API route handling

### Testing & Validation
- **✅ Dynasty Value Calculations**: Validated age curves, normalization, and composite formula

  - TE peaks at 28, slow decline (0.03 rate)
  - ADP normalization correctly inverted (lower ADP = higher value)
  - Composite formula: 50% market + 25% projection + 25% age
- **✅ ETL Pipeline**: Successfully processing 11,400+ players in batches of 100
- **✅ Database Migrations**: All new models created successfully
